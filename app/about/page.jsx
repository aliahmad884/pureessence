                        <p>In herbal medicine and in conventional medicine, each herb or medicine has an intrinsic value due to which it is used or applied. Likewise, each food, drink, herb and supplement has an intrinsic value. This value however can be reduced by time, elements, adulteration and interaction. To ensure this doesn&apos;t happen, we make sure our products are of the best and freshest quality, pure and securely packed.<br /> This is how the name PureEssence comes to be.</p><br />

                            <h2>A Message From the Founder</h2>
                            <p>Hi there, I hope you are just of a natural lover as I am.<br /><br />
                            Sometimes though, nature is not always nice. There are ill days and rough days. But that is part of life.<br/><br />
                            Despite this I consider myself fortunate to have come from a family of herbal practitioners. My father Hakim Muhammad Naseer and my maternal grandfather Hakim Ismail Rabbani were both qualified Herbal practitioners. I grew up having to know how not only medicine, but food effects us. In fact, when our intake (food, water and whatever enters our stomachs) is good and in order, then for the most part our health is in check.<br /><br />
                            In my life, I rarely have had to visit a hospital. That is comparing to the average modern citizen. That doesn&apos;t mean I wouldn&apos;t get ill. Rather, for the most part I would be treated using remedies from nature.<br /><br />
                            Today, their lives have passed, but their legacy lives on. Through the beliefs of <i><b>You Are What You Eat</b></i> and <i><b>There is Always a Cure in Nature,</b></i> I along with my family ensure we live our lives by eating healthy, and keep our healths in top condition using pure natural products.<br /><br />
                            Having known these widespread blessings in nature, and without relying too much on big pharmaceuticals (whilst still respecting and using conventional medicine), I want to share these blessings with you. Science does not invent solutions. It only discovers it. They were there all along.<br /><br />
                            Just like those who have gone before us, we too shall pass. It&apos;s best to live healthier and stronger, whilst doing good and spreading good. I hope you join me in the mission to do good. To be kind and caring to ourselves and others, by eating, drinking and healing in the best and most natural way possible, and encouraging others to do so too.<br /><br />
                            Last but not least, sharing is caring. The best way to preserve knowledge is by writing it down. That is why I will be sharing my journey, as well as sharing ideas, tips and advice on how to live a pure and healthy life.<br /><br />
